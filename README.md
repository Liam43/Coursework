# Coursework
Carlson School of Management's Masters of Science in Business Analytics program was an experience I'll never forget anytime soon. It challenged me in ways I never knew I could be challenged and I came out of the program with knowledge, experience, and connections that will last a lifetime. 

Of course, one of the things that made this program challenging was the wealth of coursework. This repository contains many of the asssignments that I did. The folders are labeled by coursename, and each of them contains a directory of topics.
